# Derberos-core
Can we get Kerberos. We have Kerberos at home. 

I find kerberos interesting and I want to mess with the concept in bash

Eventually i'm hoping to make a progect that will allow client to request passwords for services like NFS and SAMBA from  central server. 

Some how I want clients to get approved and authenthicated in a passwordless manner.

I am an expert of nothing, This just exists because i want to learn more about bash and encryption.

I might make 50 commits a day or 5 Im in no rush. 

Feel free to make comments or suggestions and give some tips
